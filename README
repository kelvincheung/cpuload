WHAT IS THIS?
=============
cpuload is a simple tool to obtain intuitive vision of CPU load
(including total, user, system, irq and softirq) within a certain
time, which is especially useful for embedded system without GUI.
It is tested with Linux 2.6.

Note that, cpuload is Linux specific -- it is based
on the Linux /proc filesystem.

Thanks to Hisham Muhammad. The code of getting CPU load is
derived from 'htop' (http://htop.sourceforge.net).
Thanks to Zack T Smith. The code of graphing is derived
from 'bandwidth' (http://zsmith.co/bandwidth.html).
